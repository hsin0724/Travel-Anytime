            <h2>Maldives</h2>
            <span>
                <p>
                    You've seen photos of the Maldives before: picture-perfect private villas suspended over striking
                    blue waters, alabaster white sand beaches and spectacular sunsets dipping into the horizon. The
                    scenic
                    beauty of the Maldives is something to behold, something you can't quite understand until you're
                    there
                    in person.
                </p>


                The island nation of the Maldives is popular with honeymooners looking for seclusion and adventurers
                looking to explore the depths of the sea on a scuba diving and snorkeling excursion. Travelers seeking
                relaxation can unwind at one of the island spas and all visitors should certainly spend a day exploring
                the Maldivian capital of Male'. The hotels in this region are also spectacular, ranging from underwater
                hotels to overwater private bungalows. However, getting to and staying in this tropical paradise
                requires patience (there are no direct flights from the United States) and plentiful cash. Located
                between the Arabian and Laccadive seas, roughly 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka, the Maldives is about
                as isolated as you can get â€“ and that's just another one of its many allures.
